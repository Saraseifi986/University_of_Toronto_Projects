Toronto-s-Rental-Market
Introduction: In this project, I explored Toronto's rental listings to understand what influences rental prices. Using data analysis and machine learning, 
I aimed to find patterns that could help renters and landlords.

The Journey Through Data: I started with a dataset of Toronto's rental properties, from condos to homes. My first task was to clean the data by dealing with
missing values and encoding categorical variables, making it ready for analysis.

Building the Models: The core of my project involved creating and testing different machine learning models to predict rental prices:

Linear Regression: Helped me understand basic relationships in the data. Decision Tree Regressor: Revealed more complex patterns but tended to overfit.
Random Forest Classifier: Balanced accuracy and generalizability. This phase was challenging and enlightening, revealing important patterns in the rental 
market.

Discoveries and Reflections: I found that location and type of listing (entire home/apt vs. private room) significantly impacted rental prices. 
Visualizations highlighted price disparities across neighborhoods and how certain features affected costs. This project showed both the potential and 
limits of data science in predicting prices.

Wrapping Up: This project enhanced my understanding of data science in real estate and sparked my curiosity to further refine my models and explore more 
aspects of the housing market. It reminded me of the power of data to reveal hidden insights and motivated me to continue this journey with curiosity and 
commitment.

Mnist
Introduction The goal of this project is to classify handwritten digits (0-9) using a neural network. 
The MNIST dataset, which consists of 60,000 training images and 10,000 test images, is used for this purpose. Each image is 28x28 pixels in size
and represents a single digit.

The neural network model is built using TensorFlow and Keras.The model is compiled using the RMSprop optimizer and binary crossentropy loss function.
It is trained for 20 epochs with a batch size of 128. The training process includes both training and validation accuracy monitoring.

The model's performance is evaluated using the test dataset. Metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score are calculated. A confusion matrix 
is also plotted to visualize the classification results. The trained model achieves an accuracy of approximately 98% on the test dataset.
Detailed evaluation metrics and confusion matrix plots are provided in the notebook.

The MNIST dataset is provided by Yann LeCun, Corinna Cortes, and Christopher J.C. Burges. TensorFlow and Keras are developed and maintained by Google.
